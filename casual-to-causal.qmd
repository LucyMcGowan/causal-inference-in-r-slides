## Causal questions

- The heart of causal analysis is the causal question.
- It dictates data analysis, methods, and target populations.


## Goals of data analysis 

Causal questions are part of a broader set of questions we can ask with statistical techniques related to the primary tasks of data science:

## Goals of data analysis 

::: small
- The goal is often muddled by both the techniques we use (regression, for instance, is helpful for all three tasks) and the way we talk about them. 
- When researchers are interested in causal inference from non-randomized data, we often use euphemistic language like *“association”* instead of declaring our intent to estimate a causal effect

## Schrödinger’s Causality

::: small
- "Associate" most common root word for effects.
- Only 1% used "cause."
- Action recommendations in 33% of studies.
- Stronger action recommendations than implied by effect description.
- Only 4% used formal causal models.

## Why Prediction ≠ Causation

Predictive power **doesn't guarantee causal accuracy**, especially when:

- The outcome has many causes but the model focuses on one exposure
- The true causal effect is small
- The model excludes non-causal predictors for methodological reasons



## The Ice Cream & Crime Example


::: small
- You have ice cream sales data but no weather data
- Ice cream sales correlate with crime rates and can predict them moderately well -- suppose this correlation exists because both variables are caused by weather!
:::

::: fragment
**Variables that are invalid from a causal perspective (like ice cream sales) can still provide predictive power by acting as proxies for true causal factors (like weather)**
