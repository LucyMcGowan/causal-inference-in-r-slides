## Causal questions

```{r}

- The heart of causal analysis is the causal question.
- It dictates data analysis, methods, and target populations.


## Goals of data analysis

Causal questions are part of a broader set of questions we can ask with statistical techniques related to the primary tasks of data science: 

  - description
  - prediction
  - causal inference 

## Goals of data analysis
- The goal is often muddled by both the techniques we use (regression, for instance, is helpful for all three tasks) and the way we talk about them. 
- When researchers are interested in causal inference from non-randomized data, we often use euphemistic language like *“association”* instead of declaring our intent to estimate a causal effect

## Schrödinger’s Causality

- "Associate" most common root word for effects.
- Only 1% used "cause."
- Action recommendations in 33% of studies.
- Stronger action recommendations than implied by effect description.
- Only 4% used formal causal models.

## Goals of data analyses

* Description
* Prediction
* Causal Inference

## Description

*What* phenomena occur / occurred in the past?

- What is the prevalence of diabetes in the United States?
- What are the demographics of our customers?

## Prediction

This often involves predicting *whether* a certain phenomena will occur given a set of circumstances

- How many people will buy our product?
- How much will this house sell for next year?

## Causal Inference

Involves understanding *why* a phenomena occurs

- Does smoking cause lung cancer?
- Does a SARS-CoV-2 infection increase the likelihood of diabetes diagnosis in kids?


#  The first step is asking a good causal question {background-color="#23373B"} 

## Diagramming causal claims

                   y = c(1, 1, 0.8, 0.7, 0.8, 0.7),
                   angle = c(0, 0, -50, 0, -50, 0))  

ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
