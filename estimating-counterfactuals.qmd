## Potential outcomes

```

* Prior to some "cause" occurring, the *potential outcomes* are all of the potential things that could occur depending on what you end up exposed to

## Potential outcomes

* Let's assume an exposure has two levels:
    - $X=1$ if you are exposed
    - $X=0$ if you are not exposed
    
## Potential outcomes

* Under this simple scenario, there are two potential outcomes:
    -   $Y(1)$ the potential outcome if you are exposed
    -   $Y(0)$ the potential outcome if you are not exposed
    
## Potential outcomes

* Only *one* of these potential outcomes will actually be realized
* It is important to remember here that these exposures are defined at a particular instance in time, so *only one* can happen to any individual
* In the case of a binary exposure, this leaves one potential outcome as *observable* and one *missing*

## Potential outcomes

* Our causal effect of interest is often some difference in potential outcomes $Y(1) - Y(0)$, averaged over a particular population

## Counterfactuals

* Early causal inference methods were often framed as missing data problems
* We need to make certain assumptions about the *missing counterfactuals*, the value of the potential outcome corresponding to the exposure(s) that did not occur
* We *wish* we could observe the conterfactual outcome that would have occurred in an alternate universe

## Counterfactuals

* To do this, we attempt to control for all factors that are related to an exposure and outcome such that we can *construct* (or estimate) such a counterfactual outcome.

### **Split Decision: Life Stories**

Award-winning actor, rapper, and producer Ice-T unveils a compelling memoir of his early life robbing jewelry stores until he found fame and fortune---while a handful of bad choices sent his former crime partner down an incredibly different path.

Ice-T and Spike Causal Map

## Ice-T and Spike

* What would need to be true for us to draw a causal conclusion?
* Can we really conclude that Spike's life would have turned out exactly like Ice-T's if he had made the exact same choices as Ice-T?


## In practice

::: small
* We could conduct an experiment where we *randomize* many individuals to leave criminal life (or not) and see how this impacts their outcomes *on average* 
* This randomized trial seems to present some ethical issues, perhaps we need to look to *observational* studies to help answer this question
* We must rely on statistical techniques to help construct these unobservable counterfactuals
